To do:
	- Add spacing option to top icons.
	These mockups look beautiful. I have a request, and this might not be the best place to ask it since you are just looking for suggestions of the UI/UX; but could we add a setting to set the padding/spacing of the top panel system icons?

	I always edit the CSS to be a little tighter w/ uniform spacing, but it gets overwritten with the elegance colors script if I try to run it at start.

	My desktop, look at top right:
